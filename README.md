This repository contains various tools to calculate the quandle counting polynomial invariant for a knotted 4-valent graph, given in a modifed Dowker-Thistletwaite notation. For more details, see the paper "Knotted 4-regular graphs: polynomial invariants and the Pachner moves", Jrnl. of Math. Phys. 63, 063502 (2022) [arXiv:2206.05816].
