This program takes a description of a knotted 4-valent graph as a planar
diagram sequence, and finds all possible induced knot diagrams for the graph.
It uses Hierholzer's algorithm to do this.

The function is given two Python lists. The first list, PD_list, is the planar
diagram sequence for the graph. Every item in PD_list represents the half-edges
incident to a given node in the graph. This representation consists of a list
of four numbers, the labels of the four incident half-edges. The list assumes
an orientation on the graph, so it starts with the incoming half-edge that
passes under the crossing (or is equivalent to that for a vertex). The other
half-edges are then given in counter-clockwise order from the first half-edge.

NOTE: The labels of the half-edges are given in reference to a particular
oriented Eulerian circuit through the graph. In this orientation, half-edges
with even labels enter a node, while odd labels indicate half-edges leaving a
node.

The second list, type_list, gives the node state and information about how the
half-edges cross each other in the given orientation. A node state has
magnitude 1 if it is a crossing, and 2 if it is a vertex; the sign comes from
the value f(i) for the given node.
