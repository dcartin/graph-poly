    "# A polynomial invariant of oriented knotted 4-valent graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Knotted 4-valent graphs arise as components of the quantum states in loop quantum gravity (LQG). In particular, the states are diffeomorphism classes of graphs embedded in a three-dimensional manifold; the edges of the graphs are colored with $SU(2)$ representations. Graphs with valence four are natural candidates for physical states, since they are dual in some sense to three-dimensional manifold triangulations. In addition, there are reasons within the theory for choosing 4-valent graphs. The LQG volume operator only gives non-trivial eigenvalues when the valence is four or greater. On the flip slide, vertices of valence five or higher have additional degrees of freedom not taken into account by the intertwiner between the $SU(2)$ representations when the diffeomorphism group acts on all points in the embedding manifold equally (Grot and Rovelli, [arXiv:gr-qc/9604010](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9604010)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This SageMath notebook is intended to take a DT sequence for an oriented knotted 4-valent graph with rigid vertices, and produce the associated graph polynomial. This is done in a few steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the orientation of the graph nodes by running the DT algorithm on the sequence, giving the $f(i)$ function on node labels $i$. The convention is that $f(i) = +1$ if the other arc crosses from right to left, and $f(i) = -1$ if the other arc crosses from left to right.\n",
    "1. Once the orientation is known, it is possible to use the graph polynomial skein relation to find the polynomial in terms of sums of polynomials in the variables $c, r, s$, each multiplied by a link. The skein relation for the graph polynomial shown below acts on a vertex.\n",
    "![](./img/Graph-poly-01.png)\n",
    "Here, the 4-valent vertex on the left in the projection plane is shown using the notation of Wan ([arXiv:0710.1312](https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.1312)). The variable coefficients can be remembered by ($c$)rossing, ($r$)everse crossing, and ($s$)plit. Taking the mirror image of this relation -- i.e. switching the crossing and vertex type as appropriate -- one obtains the skein relation when the \"upper\" edge of the vertex passes from left to right.\n",
    "1. These links can then be evaluated to find their link polynomials; here, the Jones polynomial $X(A)$ is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the DT sequence for the graph. Remember that this should be a Python list of three element lists. The first element is an even number, the second an odd; these are the two labels for that particular node. The third element gives the crossing or vertex type: -2 for a vertex with the upper edge on the odd label (label superscript $\\ell$), -1 for a crossing with the upper edge on the odd label (label superscript $-$), and the positive numbers are the flipped cases (superscripts $u$ and $+$).\n",

    "For example, the graph sequence $3^\\ell 5^u 7^+ 1^-$ corresponds to the Python list\n",

    "Then the cell below contains the actual code, which finds all possible ways to put crossings in the diagram without having a situation which can be easily removed by a RII graph move; there is no need for checking RI moves, since they would not appear with prime knotted graph. This version of the code is rather rough, and can be improved by, e.g. creating a priority queue, where graphs with one additional crossing are added only if the original graph has not already been found. This would eliminate repeated graphs, since none of the graphs found by adding crossings would not be original if the first one was not."
