This is because, depending on the connections at each vertex, the number of link components can increase or decrease by one for the $s$ terms.

At the beginning, there is only one list, since the induced knot diagram is one continuous path through the entire graph.

    "The final piece is the code that uses all of the above as a Python script in Sage. This function is called `twoVarPoly()`. This function takes a list `e_path` for a particular Eulerian circuit of a knotted graph, the PD code `PD_code` for all nodes in the graph, and the type list `type_list` for these nodes. For this choice of circuit, it returns a polynomial in the variables $c, s$ (from the vertices) and $A, A^{-1}$ (from the link coefficients). The code currently uses recursive calls -- unlike `LPoly()` -- but could be modified to use a priority queue if this speeds things up."
