    "This notebook is intended to show the process of finding the multiset of 2-variable polynomial invariants for a choice of knotted 4-valent graph $G$, and a knot invariant polynomial. It uses Python code from the package Graphpoly to do this; here are the steps used, given a specific Dowker-Thistletwaite sequence for a knotted graph.\n",

    "1. Find the planar diagram (PD) code for the graph, using the DT sequence and the orientation just found.\n",
    "1. From the PD code, find all possible Eulerian circuits through the graph. This gives the multiset of induced knot diagrams for the knot.\n",
    "1. Choose a link polynomial $L(K)$ which is invariant for any diagram of the link $K$. Use the skein relation given below for the vertices of the graph to find a polynomial in the variables $c, s$, with coefficients given by link diagrams. The brackets with subscript '$L$' refer to evaluating the resulting link using the link polynomial $L(K)$.\n",

The node labels are in the set $\\{0, 1, \\cdots, 2N - 1\\}$, for a graph with $N$ nodes. The third element gives the crossing or vertex type: -2 for a vertex with the upper edge on the odd label (label superscript $\\ell$), -1 for a crossing with the upper edge on the odd label (label superscript $-$), and the positive numbers are the flipped cases (superscripts $u$ and $+$)."

If the function is given a Python list `seq`, the function returns `True` if the sequence is a realizable DT sequence, and `False` if the sequence does not represent a planar graph. Note that the given sequence `seq` may or may not include the crossing or vertex type. If the parameter `f_list` is set to `True`, for a realizable sequence, the function will return a list of $f(i)$ values for each node label $i$. These indicate the crossing information at the node $i$ for the Eulerian circuit described by the DT sequence.
